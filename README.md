### Photo file renaming and GPS coords

A personal script to move photo files (JPG and RAW) from SD card onto Mac, rename the files with the date and time, and to add GPS data based on a GPS track.

Setup to work with cameras I use or have used.

## Usage

/currentData folder no longer used, since now stored on the SD card because I use more than one camera. But am storing a list of photos processed which at present isn't being used

## Dependencies

mini_exiftools, a Ruby script, to connect with the Perl script ExifTool by Phil Harvey, http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/, but has a Windows executable and a Mac OS X package installer available. This is a fantastic, well-maintained package to manipulate photo file EXIF data.

Requires the app Pashua for some of the GUI. However the script is initiated from the command line (or equivalent. I run from TextMate).

geonames.rb. Not sure whose version, but I have a local copy. Can't remember if gem didn't work or what.

### Notes

I'm very much an neophyte Ruby script writer, so at best use this as a guideline. Use at your own risk. I pretty much learned Ruby to write this script. I started this six years ago and am still a rank amateur. 

Many of the files aren't being used, but haven't been cleaned out.

2021.01.19 Upgrading to 2021 and seems to run OK. TM_RUBY on iMac is 2.7.1, but now at 3.0.0 on MBP. Pushed to github. Should pull to MBP. Did and then added stashed from MBP to this version.
Was behind on merging. branch 4-2021-working can be abandoned. moveToMylio had gotten left behind
