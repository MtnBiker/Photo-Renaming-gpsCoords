#### Implementation notes

GPS coords not being written to OM-1 filesâ€”maybe they are

2024.03.15 Working on OM-1 integration. Larger number of sequence shots possible. But in some cases at least there is a shot no. Did some maybe messed up fixes. Use dupCount for now. No should be able to use seq no

- how handle two cards in OM-1?

mini_exiftool did not handle getting DriveMode or Special Mode (author responded and is trying to fix it), but in the interim: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78257612/how-to-introduce-a-filename-into-shell-script-in-ruby-script#78257612 provided answers and work around.

Regular photo:
Drive Mode : Single Shot; Electronic shutter
Special Mode : Normal, Sequence: 0, Panorama: (none)

29. Focus bracketing:
    Drive Mode : Focus Bracketing, Shot 6; Electronic shutter
    Special Mode : Fast, Sequence: 6, Panorama: (none)

30. High speed sequential, SH1:
    Drive Mode : Continuous Shooting, Shot 80; Electronic shutter
    Special Mode : Fast, Sequence: 80, Panorama: (none)

For at least focus bracketing and SH1, DriveMode may be more useful info
Special Mode always has Sequence which could be used for sorting, but still wouldn't include photos just taken in the same second
--
Problem is multiple shots in same second, particularly since OM doesn't report subsecs. And can take up to 120 fps, so my old scheme of using letters fell short
At the moment I see three scenarios: 1) Normal repeated shots within same second (unlikely to be more than a few), 2) ProCapture (SH1, SH2, etc. ~ 8 variations), 3) Focus Stacking and Bracketing.
Could just add a number for each shot. That is fine for scenario 1, but for 2 and 3 might be nice to have a sequential number even or multiple seconds. Or is this unnecessarily confusing? Maybe, but I'll pursue this in this format `2024.03.30-16.48.45-5.gs.O.orf`. And using current method, the `-0` won't be shown. One complication at the moment is having to keep .jpg in Mylio since macOS doesn't handle OM-1 II files yet.
Could add a notation based on Drive Mode: brk or similar for Bracketing and `pc` or `sh` for ProCapture modes. But leave this for later. What's SH stand for? `pc` stands for too many other things

So: look for photos in same second (could miss if sequential but first is in the preceding second) and look for shot_no in Drive Mode of Special Mode. Preferring Drive Mode since also has what shooting mode.
